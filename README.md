## 📝 Abstract

Although end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving successfully maps sensor inputs to control actions in clear conditions, it hits a hard physical wall in dense cities: occlusion. When facing blind intersections, single-vehicle agents suffer from high uncertainty, often causing them to freeze or drive erratically. To fix this perception gap, we propose **CORTEX**. This framework extends the standard Trajectory-guided Control Prediction (TCP) architecture by integrating Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) data. Unlike systems that broadcast everything indiscriminately, CORTEX uses a **Request-Aware Spatial Fusion** mechanism to query Roadside Units (RSUs) only for relevant spatial features. Experiments on the V2XVerse benchmark (Town05) show that CORTEX reduces control signal noise (RMS Yaw Rate) by **74.1%** and improves heading accuracy in blind turns by **43.0%**.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The CORTEX framework consists of a dual-branch control architecture enhanced by Request-Aware V2I collaboration.
